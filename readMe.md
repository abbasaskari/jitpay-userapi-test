I implemented a backend for mobile and web applications to store and retrieve user data.
Is application get user information and generate unique userId. After that users can send their location throught their mobile. Application get these locations and save those. 
user can get latest location and a history of locations by date time range.
This application is implemented with Java 17 on Springboot framework version 2.6.8.
Of course, I have not used a special feature in Java 17 and I have used it only because this version was available on my laptop.
I used sonarqube for inspect my code and check the quality of it.
I used spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency for connecting to database and store and manage objects on it.
Used database is h2, that is the in-memory database.
The build tool used is Gradle version 7.4.2.
